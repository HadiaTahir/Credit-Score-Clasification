#Credit Score Classification Using Random Forest
This project focuses on classifying credit scores using a Random Forest classifier, a powerful and versatile ensemble learning technique. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (for classification) of the individual trees. This approach enhances predictive accuracy and controls overfitting.

#Overview
Credit scoring is a crucial task in the financial industry, used to assess the creditworthiness of applicants. In this project, we apply Random Forest to classify credit scores based on various financial features and applicant details. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a credit applicant being a good or bad credit risk.

#Key Components
Data Preparation: The dataset includes various features related to the credit applicants, such as income, loan amount, credit history, etc. We preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Model Training: The Random Forest algorithm is employed to train a model on the prepared dataset. It leverages the power of multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and robustness.

Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also perform cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.

Visualization: Feature importance is visualized to understand which factors have the most significant impact on credit scoring decisions. This helps in interpreting the model and making informed decisions.
